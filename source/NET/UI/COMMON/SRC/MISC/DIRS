Revision History:

    Ben Goetter (beng) 25-Sep-2000
        Created from template.

    Ben Goetter (beng) 16-Oct-2000
        Folded uiassert and uitrace into single "trace."
        Implement library merging.

    Keith Moore (keithmo) 04-Nov-2000
        Added "heap" back to the dirs list, since we have
        no LIBCX32.LIB for MIPS.

    Ben Goetter (beng) 29-Mar-2000
        Added "wcsaux," for wide-char fcns missing from public libs

    beng 10-May-2000
        Remove wcsaux - no longer needed
